#### WORDPRESS CHAT PLUGIN
Use the WordPress Rake Live Chat Plugin to enable real-time engagement tools like  live chat and visitor monitoring to your WordPress website with minimal setup required. Instantly engage with on-site visitors and customers and enable a quick resolution to their questions or concerns.

Increase online sales and conversions, and build stronger customer relationships with a fully functional WordPress live chat plugin.

#### FEATURE-RICH WORDPRESS LIVE CHAT PLUGIN
Rake comes with an impressive set of features built to help you engage, support, collaborate, and convert website visitors into clients.  All Rake plans include proactive messages, real-time visitor monitoring, and chat invitations that allow agents to send personalized messages to visitors at the exact right moment. You can trigger proactive messages when a visitor meets predefined criteria, e.g. the time spent on a page, scroll position on the page, or words/letters the page URL contains.

Rake streamlines conversations, making you more efficient and productive. Conduct multiple chat sessions at the same time, send canned quick replies to frequently asked questions, tag your chats for sorting and grouping in reports, and send or receive files or images to visitors through the chat widget. You can even chat internally with Channel and Direct Messaging tools similar to popular workplace collaboration apps.

Rake also comes with our exclusive BeeOpen service. A built-in live agent contact center that enables your business to extend your support 24/7/365. The optional BeeOpen service helps you flex your service or sales team during busy periods, or save when business is really slow because you only pay for what you use. BeeOpen agents are live chat experts, they follow your script and collect and qualify leads or route customers to your internal subject matter experts. After BeeOpen agents complete a chat, users are instantly notified via Email, SMS, or push-notifications using Rake's built in tasks and notifications system.
